    <p style="text-align: center;">
        The other night 'bout two o'clock, or maybe it was three,<br>
        An elephant with shining tusks came chasing after me.<br>
        His trunk was wavin' in the air an'  spoutin' jets of steam<br>
        An' he was out to eat me up, but still I didn't scream<br>
        Or let him see that I was scared - a better thought I had,<br>
        I just escaped from where I was and crawled in bed with dad.<br>
        <br>
        One time there was a giant who was horrible to see,<br>
        He had three heads and twenty arms, an' he came after me<br>
        And red hot fire came from his mouths and every hand was red<br>
        And he declared he'd grind my bones and make them into bread.<br>
        But I was just too smart for him, I fooled him might bad,<br>
        Before his hands could collar me I crawled in bed with dad.<br>
        <br>
        I ain't scared of nothin that comes pesterin' me at night.<br>
        Once I was chased by forty ghosts all shimmery an' white.<br>
        An' I just raced 'em round the room an' let 'em think maybe<br>
        I'd have to stop an' rest awhile, when they could capture me.<br>
        Then when they leapt onto my bed, Oh Gee! But they were mad<br>
        To find that I had slipped away an' crawled in bed with dad.<br>
        <br>
        No giants, ghosts or elephants have dared to come in there<br>
        'Coz if they did he'd beat 'em up and chase 'em to their lair.<br>
        They just hang 'round the children's rooms<br>
        an' snap an' snarl an' bite<br>
        An' laugh if they can make 'em yell<br>
        for help with all their might.<br>
        But I don't ever yell out loud. I'm not that sort of lad,<br>
        I slip from out the covers and I crawl in bed with dad.<br>
        <br>

        Figure it out for yourself, my lad,<br />
        You've all that the greatest of men have had,<br />
        Two arms, two hands, two legs, two eyes,<br />
        And a brain to use if you would be wise.<br />
        With this equipment they all began,<br />
        So start for the top and say "I can."<br />
        <br />
        Look them over, the wise and great,<br />
        They take their food from a common plate<br />
        And similar knives and forks they use,<br />
        With similar laces they tie their shoes,<br />
        The world considers them brave and smart.<br />
        But you've all they had when they made their start.<br />
        <br />
        You can triumph and come to skill,<br />
        You can be great if only you will,<br />
        You're well equipped for what fight you choose,<br />
        You have legs and arms and a brain to use,<br />
        And the man who has risen, great deeds to do<br />
        Began his life with no more than you.<br />
        <br />
        You are the handicap you must face,<br />
        You are the one who must choose your place,<br />
        You must say where you want to go.<br />
        How much you will study the truth to know,<br />
        God has equipped you for life, But He<br />
        Lets you decide what you want to be.<br />
        <br />
        Courage must come from the soul within,<br />
        The man must furnish the will to win,<br />
        So figure it out for yourself, my lad,<br />
        You were born with all that the great have had,<br />
        With your equipment they all began.<br />
        Get hold of yourself, and say: "I can."	etter drop the song<br>
        Of elephop and telephong!)<br>

        When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br>
        When the road you’re trudging seems all up hill,<br>
        When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br>
        And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,<br>
        When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>
        Rest if you must—but don’t you quit.<br>
        <br>
        Life is queer with its twists and turns,<br>
        As every one of us sometimes learns,<br>
        And many a failure turns about<br>
        When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br>
        Don’t give up, though the pace seems slow—<br>
        You may succeed with another blow.<br>
        <br>
        Often the goal is nearer than<br>
        It seems to a faint and faltering man,<br>
        Often the struggler has given up<br>
        When he might have captured the victor’s cup,<br>
        And he learned too late, when the night slipped down,<br>
        How close he was to the golden crown.<br>
        <br>
        Success is failure turned inside out—<br>
        The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br>
        And you never can tell how close you are,<br>
        It may be near when it seems afar;<br>
        So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit—<br>
        It’s when things seem worst that you mustn’t quit.<br>
